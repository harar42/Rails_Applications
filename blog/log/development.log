Je parlais tout le temps de lui, je \"mangeais\" Zidane. C'est toujours un plaisir d'entendre un joueur que j'ai admiré, parler de moi. J'ai toujours apprécié Zidane» , a-t-il renchéri. Il y a près d'un an, ZZ n'avait pas hésité à faire du meilleur joueur de Premier League 2014-2015 l'égal des Lionel Messi et Cristiano Ronaldo. «Tout ce qu'il fait sur le terrain me plaît. J'aime son comportement, son côté décisif et le fait de le voir progresser chaque année. Il a encore une bonne marge de progression» , notait celui qui était alors entraîneur du Castilla. «J'adore le voir jouer car c'est un joueur qui crée des choses et c'est souvent spectaculaire de le voir jouer. Est-ce que je le vois aller au Real ? Demandez ça à quelqu'un d'autre. J'aime le joueur et c'est tout» , avait-il nuancé peu avant sa prise de fonctions. - Source: Maxifoot, http://www.maxifoot.fr/football/article-27760.htm#footref"}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"3"}
